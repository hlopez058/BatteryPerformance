Battery Model using Shepards equation
======

The simplified battery model uses shepards euqation to mathematically represent the voltage of a battery.

a controlled voltage source is needed to use the model in a simulated circuit enviornment.

I will try to model the circuit completely using simulink objects not powersim libraries.
 a controlled voltage source will be then modeled to and compared to a mathematical equivalent of to compare the outputs.

Use the tables laid out in the [1] paper to provide the models.

after modeling the three batteries.
create a load that would make sense, then have it run under some real conditions.

also try to combine the batteries into a BMS system.
a BMS system that holds the batteries in containers that have thier own smaller BMS systems. the MBMS system should be in charge of the all the batteries.

can an inverter model also be created that will convert the DC current from the batteries to AC grid voltages of 134kv lines.

a battery bank of 1MW can be simulated.
